I'm Steven Chung. I’ve been a full stack web developer based in Toronto for about 10 years. I've worked remotely with clients in the US and France.

These days, my thinking revolves around how humans adapt to the modern world. Topics span from learning about (psychology, anthropology, design) to history (economic, cultural, technological) to understanding technology (programming, startups, scalability). Maybe I’ll write a book someday, but I imagine it will take years.
